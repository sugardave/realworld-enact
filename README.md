# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Enact codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Enact** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Enact** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

This project was bootstrapped with [@enact/cli](https://github.com/enactjs/cli).  Please see the most recent version of the [`README`](https://github.com/enactjs/templates/blob/master/packages/moonstone/template/README.md) for Enact templates.

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `package.json` is the core package manifest for the project
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

# Getting started

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Builds and serves the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run pack` and `npm run pack-p`

Builds the project in the working directory. Specifically, `pack` builds in development mode with code un-minified and with debug code included, whereas `pack-p` builds in production mode, with everything minified and optimized for performance. Be sure to avoid shipping or performance testing on development mode builds.

### `npm run watch`

Builds the project in development mode and keeps watch over the project directory. Whenever files are changed, added, or deleted, the project will automatically get rebuilt using an active shared cache to speed up the process. This is similar to the `serve` task, but without the http server.

### `npm run clean`

Deletes previous build fragments from ./dist.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the Enact configuration of Eslint on the project for syntax analysis.

### `npm run test` and `npm run test-watch`

These tasks will execute all valid tests (files that end in `-specs.js`) that are within the project directory. The `test` is a standard single execution pass, while `test-watch` will set up a watcher to re-execute tests when files change.
